# MiniCompilerSoftware
A mini compiler software written in JAVA that would accept any string in the form of statement as used in programming languages.

-The program accepts any string and report the correctness or
otherwise of each string.

-The program should ask the user for a string and check for correctness.

-If the string is correct, the program does the translation by going through
all the 7 stages below.

-If the string is wrong, then it reports the errors and no translation is done
in stages 1 to 7.

-There programs has one entry and one exit point.

-The output of the program contains the following stages of Compiler
Techniques:

Stages of Compiler Techniques:

Stage 1: Lexical Analysis
Stage 2: Syntax Analysis
Stage 3: Semantic Analysis
Stage 4: Intermediate Code Representation
Stage 5: Code Generation
Stage 6: Code Optimisation
Stage 7: Target Machine Code

-The project contains an executable file, that can be run as a single file on cmd.

THE ABOVE PROJECT WAS GIVEN IN COMPILER TECHNIQUES AS FINAL GROUP PROJECT AT Namibia University of Science and Technology. By prof Azeta Ambrose
