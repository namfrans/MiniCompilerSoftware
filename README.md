# MiniCompilerSoftware
A mini compiler software written in JAVA that would accept any string in the form of statement as used in programming languages.

- The program accepts any string and report the correctness or
otherwise of each string.

- The program should ask the user for a string and check for correctness.

- If the string is correct, the program does the translation by going through
all the 7 stages below.

- If the string is wrong, then it reports the errors and no translation is done
in stages 1 to 7.

- There programs has one entry and one exit point.

- The output of the program contains the following stages of Compiler
Techniques:

#### Stages of Compiler Techniques:

1. Lexical Analysis
2. Syntax Analysis
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Intermediate Code Representation
5. Code Generation
6. Code Optimisation
7. Target Machine Code

- The project contains an executable file, that can be run as a single file on cmd.
